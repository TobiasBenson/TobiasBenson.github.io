<p> Hello! I am Tobias Benson. I attended Hazen Union school for 3 years and did one year of early college at Vermont <br>
    State Universities in computer engineering. I like to play video games and tabletop strategy games, especially with <br>
    friends. I also just got into game design and development.<br></p>
